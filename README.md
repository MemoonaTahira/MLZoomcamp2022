# [MLZoomcamp2022](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp) by [DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club/)

This is a 4 month practical bootcamp that puts you on the fast-track to becoming a **Machine Learning Engineer**:

  - It starts from the basics of Machine and Deep Learning using a **CRISP-DM Methodology** 
  - It looks at internal mechanism of some of the most popular ML algorithms such as **Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Ensemble Learning** such as **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**, as well **Neural Networks** for Deep Learning.
  - It then goes on to the packaging and deployment of ML/DL models with **Docker, Flask** and **BentoML** to cloud services
  - The cloud services used are **AWS EC2 and Lambda** (for serverless computing)
  - Additionally, it covers some essential advanced topics such as working with **tflite** and **TensorFlow serving**, as well as **Kubernetes** and **KServe** 
  - Finally, it ties everything together with 2-3 student-led **projects** that employ the tools and knowledge learned in the bootcamp

The **highlights** of the course are:

  - Focus on **collaborative problem solving**, getting hands on with **git** and **sharing in public** via notes and write-ups
  - It also includes **weekly homeworks** that serve as a guided walk-through of the concepts learned during the week
  - **Peer-reviewing** and **evaluation** of projects
